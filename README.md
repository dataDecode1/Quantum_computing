-2018: Quantum computer solves cancer, science, break all existing cryptography / security in next 5 years

- Explain quantum to child, teen, college student, grad, professional - https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=200&v=OWJCfOvochA&feature=emb_logo

- Normal computers / supercomputer can run out of space when solving compley problems. Quantum comouter can solve the storage problem. Quantum can be used to Simulate chemical bondings like Simulating nature / modelligng atomic bond.  Can aslo be used for ML problems. 

- IBM Q devices are accessed and used with Qiskit, a python-based programming framework that is open, fully modular and doesnâ€™t require a new programming language. Users can accelerate quantum expertise with the IBM Q Experience, which offers tutorials and a graphical user interface for programming IBM Q devices. 

- As we need fridgers, cooling systems to cool down entaglements in quantum comouter, most probably tough to have this sytem at home. But, we can access quantum computer through cloud.

- How we encode ? Each qubit carriy quantum info. Flip satte of quibut from 0 to 1. With miicrowaves. 

- Quantum algos are 2 types - shores (factoring) , grovers (unstructures search) for perfect fault tolerant computer.

- co.evolution of s/w, h/w, middleware.
