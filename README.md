- Explain quantum to child, teen, college student, grad, professional - https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=200&v=OWJCfOvochA&feature=emb_logo
- Normal computers / supercomputer can run out of space when solving compley problems. Quantum comouter can solve the storage problem. Quantum can be used to Simulate chemical bondings like Simulating nature / modelligng atomic bond.  Can aslo be used for ML problems. 

- For prgrammers, assembly language is used currently, But, this will change to high level languages later.

- As we need fridgers, coolin systems to coll down entaglemetns in quantum comouter, most probably tough to have this sytem at home. But, we can access quantum computer through cloud.
