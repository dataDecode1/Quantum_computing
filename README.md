-2018: Quantum computer solves cancer, science, break all existing cryptography / security in next 5 years

- Explain quantum to child, teen, college student, grad, professional - https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=200&v=OWJCfOvochA&feature=emb_logo

- Normal computers / supercomputer can run out of space when solving compley problems. Quantum comouter can solve the storage problem. Quantum can be used to Simulate chemical bondings like Simulating nature / modelligng atomic bond.  Can aslo be used for ML problems. Rigorous research conducted by IBM experts has demonstrated foundational elements for applications in chemistry, optimization and machine learning. More than 90,000 users have run more than four million experiments on IBM Q devices and 110 research papers have been written by non-IBMers based on these experiments.

- IBM Q devices are accessed and used with Qiskit, a python-based programming framework that is open, fully modular and doesnâ€™t require a new programming language. Users can accelerate quantum expertise with the IBM Q Experience, which offers tutorials and a graphical user interface for programming IBM Q devices. 

- IBM Q on cloud - As we need fridgers, cooling systems to cool down entaglements in quantum comouter, most probably tough to have this sytem at home. But, we can access quantum computer through cloud.

- How we encode ? Each qubit carriy quantum info. Flip satte of quibut from 0 to 1. With miicrowaves. Quantum algos are 2 types - shores (factoring) , grovers (unstructures search) for perfect fault tolerant computer. co.evolution of s/w, h/w, middleware.
